Abstract:

> Since the 1980s, there is an upward trend in late fertility in Western
> countries and there are also more and more first births. This thesis
> focuses on late transitions to motherhood and to fatherhood, in the
> French context, which is characterized by a strong parental norm. I
> start questioning the definition of a late age at first birth, and use
> the thresholds of 35 for women and 38 for men. Defined that way, a
> late entry into parenthood can be understood as an ambivalent
> relationship with norms: on the one hand, one could consider it as a
> chosen deviation from the procreative norm, notably from the 'right
> age' to conceive. On the other hand, one could perceive it as a
> product of the normative framework that defines the 'right conditions'
> prior to the arrival of a child. This ambivalence is first noticeable
> through a textual analysis of a corpus of online media. The objective
> is, then, to understand the increase in late first births according to
> gender, education as well as professional and partnership pathways. To
> do this, I use qualitative materials and methods (interviews) and
> quantitative data -- EDP (Insee, 2016) and Épic survey (Ined-Insee,
> 2013--2014). While the people with the most cultural and social
> resources not only are those who postpone entry into parenthood the
> most, but are also groups that manage to renegotiate with norms. The
> analysis of catching-up on a first birth at late reproductive ages is,
> then, an opportunity to see how unequal gender and social relations
> unfold in the access to parental status.
