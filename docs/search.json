Becoming a late\r\nfather or a late mother facing norms and age].\r\nlink.\r\nSupervisors : Elise de La Rochebrochard (Ined, Inserm) and Arnaud\r\nRégnier-Loilier (Ined)\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nSince the 1980s, there is an upward trend in late fertility in Western\r\ncountries and there are also more and more first births. This thesis\r\nfocuses on late transitions to motherhood and to fatherhood, in the\r\nFrench context, which is characterized by a strong parental norm. I\r\nstart questioning the definition of a late age at first birth, and use\r\nthe thresholds of 35 for women and 38 for men. Defined that way, a\r\nlate entry into parenthood can be understood as an ambivalent\r\nrelationship with norms: on the one hand, one could consider it as a\r\nchosen deviation from the procreative norm, notably from the ‘right\r\nage’ to conceive. On the other hand, one could perceive it as a\r\nproduct of the normative framework that defines the ‘right conditions’\r\nprior to the arrival of a child. This ambivalence is first noticeable\r\nthrough a textual analysis of a corpus of online media. The objective\r\nis, then, to understand the increase in late first births according to\r\ngender, education as well as professional and partnership pathways. To\r\ndo this, I use qualitative materials and methods (interviews) and\r\nquantitative data – EDP (Insee, 2016) and Épic survey (Ined-Insee,\r\n2013–2014). While the people with the most cultural and social\r\nresources not only are those who postpone entry into parenthood the\r\nmost, but are also groups that manage to renegotiate with norms. The\r\nanalysis of catching-up on a first birth at late reproductive ages is,\r\nthen, an opportunity to see how unequal gender and social relations\r\nunfold in the access to parental status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
